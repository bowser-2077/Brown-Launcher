## ✨ What is CascadeMC?

CascadeMC is a **Python-based Minecraft launcher** designed for users who want:

* A fast and minimal launcher
* Full control over their Minecraft setup
* Crack support without Microsoft authentication
* Open-source transparency

It supports **Vanilla** and **Fabric**, with basic mod functionality already available.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* The **compiled (.exe) version may not work on all systems**.
* For best stability, **install via source code** and run it manually.
* Mod support is available but **still experimental**.

## 🔓 Authentication & Crack Support

✔ **Yes, crack is supported**
CascadeMC is a cracked launcher **by default** and will **never add Microsoft authentication**.

* Uses **authlib-injector** for multiplayer support
* Offline & custom usernames supported

---

## 🛡️ Is CascadeMC Safe?

Yes.

* CascadeMC is **100% open source**
* You can inspect, audit, and compile the code yourself
* No hidden behavior, no telemetry, no closed-source components

Unlike launchers such as *TLauncher*, CascadeMC is fully transparent.
