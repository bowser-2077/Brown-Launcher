### Whats brown launcher?
Brown Launcher is a lightwheigt minecraft launcher for the 1.16.5 (Only for now...)

### Mod Support?
Unfortunately, not for now, its planned but idk when this will come. But you can install mods manually by installing forge or fabric on the "**minecraft_data**" folder after the first launch.

### Crack Support?

Yes, brown launcher is a cracked launcher by default and will never add microsoft auth system.

### Is there viruses?

Since brown launcher is open source, you can check the sourcecode and compile it by yourself, I am not like TLauncher :)
